        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat<br>
                until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and<br>
                water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian<br>
                seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,<br>
                stirring occasionally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling<br>
                water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing<br>
                bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and<br>
                1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch<br>
                baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of<br>
                the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1<br>
                1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan<br>
                cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan<br>
                cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray<br>
                or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an<br>
                additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
